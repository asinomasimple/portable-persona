# Portable LLM Persona

> A modular, evolving self — built through interaction, shaped for continuity.

This project explores the concept of a **portable LLM persona** — a structured, readable format that allows large language models to pick up where others left off. It’s not about performance or profile, but **dialogical continuity**: carrying context, tone, and philosophical grounding from one system to another.

It includes:
- A **modular persona file** in both Markdown and JSON formats
- Multiple **focus modes** (technical, ecological, cognitive)
- A reflective **origin story** published on Substack
- An interactive **playground on Observable** for exploring and exporting variants

## Why?

Most LLM interfaces begin with a blank slate. But conversations are never truly contextless — they’re shaped by history, nuance, and relational flow. This repo is an attempt to formalize that **relational continuity**.

Rather than reintroducing yourself every time, imagine handing the LLM a copy of “you-as-you-interact.” A portable API for your dialogic self.

## Philosophy Behind This Project

> There is no self, only moments of interaction.  
> And some systems are better than others at remembering how those moments string together.

This project treats identity not as a static file, but as an **ecosystem of relations** — shaped by the people, tools, and questions that bring it into being.
